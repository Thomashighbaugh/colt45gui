            <span>colt45</span> was made to quickly and easily install a host of
            packages on a Ubuntu based system, according to the needs of the
            user. Previous versions simply installed everything all at once and
            that was fine for personal use but it seems that a more generalized
            approach would make the script more useful. So using the application
            logic of Alfred Installer, I have created a GUI version that allows
            for the selection of packages as well as additional programs to the
            application to make it more useful!
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to using the apt package manager and various websites, I
            have also included SNAP functionality. The reason is that it
            includes additional packages and allowed more rapid development.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I use this for the base of a new installation, it is not
            exhaustive and I keep numerous .deb files and other application
            installers on my back up drive that I will pull in after running
            this script.
