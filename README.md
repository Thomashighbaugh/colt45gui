#colt45 v3: GUI colt45

This project was forked originally from the shell script of the _Alfred Installer_ (which is in Python now and the script is deprecated) While modernizing the deprecated shell script I changed/added extensively to the applications available and modified some of the design logical and commentary systems apply. I also included snap functionality into the installer to maximize the programs offered.
